      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Pich Chandy! I graduated from high school in 2024 and am now a freshman at The University of Cambodia,
         majoring in Computer Science. 
         I was fortunate to receive a 60% scholarship to support my studies. 
         I have a strong passion for technology, and in my free time, 
         I enjoy reading and learning to code by watching videos on social media. 
         I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in the field of computer science.</p>
